## Getting Started

1. 📦 **Fork** `sytraio/protocol` and clone your fork.  
2. 🌍 Navigate to the part of the repo you'd like to improve (e.g., `/docs/`, `/schemas/`).  
3. 🧰 Create a **feature branch** with a short, descriptive name (e.g., `fix-issue-42`, `add-use-case-cla`).  
4. 🧹 Make your changes and **commit** clearly (e.g., “Improve scoring logic example in scoring-logic.md”).  
5. 🔄 **Pull** from `sytraio/protocol:main` regularly to avoid conflicts.

---

## How to Submit Changes

Once your feature branch is ready:

1. Push your branch to your fork.  
2. Open a **Pull Request (PR)** to `sytraio/protocol:main`.  
3. Fill out the PR template (title, summary, linked issues).  
4. Add a link to any relevant discussions or RFCs.  
5. A maintainer will review — expect responsive feedback within 3 business days.

## RFCs & Major Changes

For significant additions (new metrics, scoring logic, certification paths):

1. Create a draft in `/discussions` named `rfc-XX-title.md`.  
2. Structure it with:
   - **Background / Motivation**
   - **Proposal**
   - **Benefits / Drawbacks**
   - **Implementation outline**
   - **Compatibility impacts**
3. Open a **GitHub Discussion** under `RFCs`.  
4. Upon community discussion and advisory team review, core maintainers will formalize these into pull requests and votes.
