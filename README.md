# SYTRAIO Protocol

**The Open Standard for AI Optimization and Machine-Trust in Digital Content**

Welcome to `sytraio/protocol` — the official repository of the SYTRAIO Protocol, a dynamic open framework that defines what it means for digital experiences to be **AI-Optimized (AIO)**.

This protocol enables websites, platforms, and digital content creators to meet the evolving standards of **AI discoverability, machine interpretability, and responsible AI disclosure**.

---

## 🔍 What Is the SYTRAIO Protocol?

The SYTRAIO Protocol governs the creation, evaluation, and certification of AI-Optimized digital systems. It provides:

- 📊 **Transparent Scoring Logic** for AIO audits
- 🤖 **Machine-Trust Metrics** for AI alignment and reliability
- 📄 **AI Disclosure Guidelines** for ethical content attribution
- 📈 **Certification Criteria** for SYTRAIO’s official trustmark

This standard is **open-source**, community-driven, and designed to evolve alongside advances in artificial intelligence, large language models, and AI-native web infrastructure.
