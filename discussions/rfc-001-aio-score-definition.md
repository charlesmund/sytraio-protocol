## üß≠ Summary

This RFC proposes a formal definition, structure, and scoring rubric for the **AIO Score (AI Optimization Score)**‚Äîthe primary quantitative output of the SYTRAIO Protocol. The AIO Score is designed to measure a digital asset‚Äôs alignment with machine-readability, AI discoverability, and trustworthiness for generative and retrieval-based AI systems.

The AIO Score is intended to become a cross-industry standard that enables digital entities to gauge, improve, and certify their presence within AI-native ecosystems.

## üìò Background

As AI agents‚Äîespecially large language models (LLMs)‚Äîincreasingly act as the first point of contact for web search, content curation, and decision-making, traditional SEO and AEO methods are no longer sufficient. These legacy systems:

- Emphasize *human-first navigation*, not *machine-first interpretation*
- Lack a standard trust signal for generative models
- Cannot quantify an entity‚Äôs transparency, attribution, or verifiability in AI contexts

The AIO Score aims to address this gap by offering a structured, defensible scoring framework for AI visibility, trust, and accessibility.

## üß† Proposed Definition

> **The AIO Score** is a composite, weighted score from 0 to 100 that reflects how well a digital asset aligns with AI Optimization standards across five core categories:
>
> **Discoverability, Interpretability, Trustworthiness, Attribution, and Format Fidelity.**

## üß© Core Scoring Categories

| Category           | Weight | Description |
|--------------------|--------|-------------|
| **1. Discoverability**     | 25%    | Structured data, crawlability, and semantic metadata alignment (Schema.org, JSON-LD, etc.) |
| **2. Interpretability**    | 20%    | Clarity, context depth, and minimal ambiguity for machine parsing (token cohesion, LLM summarization fidelity) |
| **3. Trustworthiness**     | 20%    | Indicators of domain authority, source consistency, and verifiable claims |
| **4. Attribution**         | 20%    | Disclosed content authorship, citations, original vs. AI-generated labeling |
| **5. Format Fidelity**     | 15%    | Consistency of data delivery across formats (HTML, PDF, API, mobile), ensuring AI can replicate and reason over structure |

Each category contains sub-criteria, scored on a 5-point scale, which are normalized and weighted to yield a final **AIO Score** between `0.0` and `100.0`.

## üìà Example Output Format

```json
{
  "url": "https://example.com",
  "aio_score": 86.4,
  "breakdown": {
    "discoverability": 23.5,
    "interpretability": 18.2,
    "trustworthiness": 17.5,
    "attribution": 18.1,
    "format_fidelity": 9.1
  },
  "certified": true,
  "version": "SYTRAIO v1.0"
}
üß™ Evaluation Methodology
A standardized scoring engine will analyze the digital entity using the following methods:

Schema Parsing: For structural compliance

AI Summary Consistency Tests: Run LLM on-page interpretation vs. source intent

Metadata Audit: Validate labeling and canonical truth signals

Content Provenance Check: Examine authorship disclosures and AI usage declarations

Delivery Layer Evaluation: Ensure accessibility consistency across formats

All scoring outputs must be deterministic, explainable, and reproducible across audits.

üîÑ Versioning Considerations
This RFC defines SYTRAIO Protocol v1.0 scoring structure

Changes to weights, categories, or methods must trigger new RFCs

AIO Scores must always be version-tagged in outputs (e.g., version: SYTRAIO v1.1)

üì£ Call for Feedback
We invite public commentary, proposed modifications, and suggested sub-criteria under the "RFCs" category in GitHub Discussions.

Open Questions:
Should LLM summarization fidelity be tested across multiple model providers?

Should scoring engines offer an explainability layer for each score component?

How should subdomain and multi-language pages be audited for fairness?
